# PocketMuse — 3 Minute Video Script

## 🎬 0:00–0:10 — Hook
“Imagine turning a vague idea like ‘AI apps’ into a complete, ready-to-build project in under 10 seconds. That’s what PocketMuse does.”

## 🧩 0:10–0:30 — Problem
“Ideation is the hardest part of building projects. Research, brainstorming, and planning take hours. Many projects die before they begin.”

## 🤖 0:30–1:00 — Why Agents?
“Instead of one big LLM prompt, PocketMuse uses a multi-agent workflow:
• Research agent  
• Parallel ideation agents  
• Validation agent  
• Composer agent  

Each agent has a specific role — making the system modular, intelligent, and explainable.”

## 🏗️ 1:00–1:40 — Architecture
(Show architecture diagram)
“PocketMuse uses tools, memory, observability, and Gemini as the LLM backbone.”

## 🧪 1:40–2:15 — Demo
(Show terminal)
“Here’s a run: research logs, idea generation, feasibility score, and a final one-page project pitch with a 7-day roadmap.”

## ⚙️ 2:15–2:40 — The Build
“I built this using Python, google-genai (Gemini), custom tools, memory, and structured logs. The repository is fully reproducible.”

## 🚀 2:40–3:00 — Closing
“PocketMuse makes starting a project effortless. Thank you for watching.”
